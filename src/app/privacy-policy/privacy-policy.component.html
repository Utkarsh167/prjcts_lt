               <p>HappyOrNot may share your information with third party service providers to provide you the Services, to facilitate your use of our Services, to process any financial transactions you make through our Services, or to provide technical support. This means for example third party vendors who provide the necessary software, networking, storage and other similar technology that are required to provide the Services. Except as set forth in this Policy, these third party service providers must only use your information to provide the services requested by HappyOrNot.</p>
               <h5><strong>Disclosing personal data to competent authorities or for safety reasons</strong></h5>
               <p>We may share your personal data to comply with requests from competent authorities or related to legal proceedings when this is permitted or required by law, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>
               <h5><strong>Information we disclose with your consent or at your request</strong></h5>
               <p>If you have expressly requested that we do so, we may share your personal data with (i) third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites; and/or (ii) third-party application developers.</p>
               <h4><strong>Third-Party Sites, Applications and Services</strong></h4>
               <p>Our Services may contain links to other websites and services, and some of our Services may be accessed through third-party applications or services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website, application, or service (“Third-Party Services”) is provided directly to the owner or operator of such Third-Party Services and is subject to that party’s privacy policy. Even if such Third-Party Services are accessible through our Services, our Privacy Policy does not apply to such Third-Party Services and we shall not be held responsible for the content, privacy, or security practices and policies of such Third-Party Services.

               <h4><strong>Transferring your personal data outside the EU/EEA</strong></h4>
               <p>Some of our Affiliates and third-party service providers process personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA):</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>For example some of the personal data is stored on cloud-based servers which can be geographically located outside the EEA, such as in the United States</li>
                  <li>HappyOrNot has employees in the United States and in Japan, who in some cases may have access to the personal data of EU residents</li>
                  <li>Our resellers are located all over the world; the resellers mostly process personal data of their local contacts, but they may also in some situations have access to the personal data of EU residents.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>If personal data of EU residents is in any way transferred or processed outside the EEA, we take all necessary steps to ensure that such personal data continues to be adequately protected. Usually we use EU Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (as required by Article 46.2 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation), which means that we have a contract in place with our affiliates or service providers, requiring these parties to process personal data in a secure manner. If you would like find out more about this, please contact <a href="mailto:security@happy-or-not.com">security@happy-or-not.com</a>.</p>
               <h4><strong>Retention of personal data </strong></h4>

               <p>Most of your personal data will be retained during the course of your customer relationship with HappyOrNot. Some personal data might be retained after your customer relationship with us has ended, if required or allowed by applicable laws; for example, applicable tax and accounting legislation requires us to keep some information for six years and in some cases even longer. &nbsp;When your personal data is no longer required by law or rights or obligations by either party, we will delete your personal data.</p>
               <p>Personal data which is not necessary for the customer relationship will be deleted or anonymized as soon as possible after the collection of such personal data and at latest within 12 months.</p>
               <h4><strong>Your rights</strong></h4>
               <p>You have a right to access personal data we process about you. You may access, correct, update, change or remove your personal data at any time. However, please note that certain information is strictly necessary in order to fulfil the purposes defined in this Policy and may also be required by law. Thus, you may not remove such personal data.</p>
               <p>You have a right to object for certain processing. To the extent required by applicable data protection law, you have a right to restrict data processing.</p>
               <p>You have a right to data portability, i.e. right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format and transmit your personal data to another data controller, to the extent required by applicable law.</p>
               <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a right to complain to a supervisory authority in accordance with Article 77 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation.

               <h4><strong>Security of your information</strong></h4>
               <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.&nbsp;Our Services have security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. When our Services are accessed using a supported browser, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that data are safe, secure, and available only to you. HappyOrNot also implements a security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the website in a server environment designed to be secure and that uses a firewall and other technology designed to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. HappyOrNot provides unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs in to our Services. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of personal data.</p>
               <h4><strong>Sensitive Information</strong></h4>
               <p>Our purposes of processing your personal data (as described above) do not necessitate collecting and processing of any sensitive information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background, or trade union membership). We kindly ask you to not send any sensitive information on or through our Services or via any other means as this poses unnecessary risks to your privacy.</p>
               <h4><strong>Changes to Privacy Policy</strong></h4>
               <p>We may modify and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time if this is necessary for example due to changes in the Services. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of such changes by email or other appropriate mode of communication.</p>
