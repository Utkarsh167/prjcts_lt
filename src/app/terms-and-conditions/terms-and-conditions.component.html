If Goods ordered are in stock then OMBEA aims to despatch the Goods within three working days of the day the order is received or, if later, by the date set out in the Buyer's order.

Goods that have been ordered from OMBEA but not paid for in full ("Unpaid Goods") must be clearly identified as belonging to OMBEA and kept safe, secure, comprehensively insured against loss and damage and separate from other property.

              (a) part with possession of the Unpaid Goods;<br>
              (b) allow any right to be created over the Unpaid Goods; or<br>

Without prejudice to clause 8.2, if the Buyer does not receive all of the Goods or it is found that any of the Goods do not conform to these terms and conditions or differ from the Goods ordered, then you must notify us of this fact in writing within 3 days of the date of delivery of the Goods.  If no notification is received within this period then it will be deemed the Buyer has accepted: they have received the right quantity of Goods; the Goods are free from damage; and the Goods conform to these terms and conditions and are the Goods ordered.<br>
              8.4.    If you notify us that you or your end customer have not received all of the Goods you ordered then you must promptly provide us with reasonable evidence supporting your claim. If we accept your claim then we will by way of full and final settlement of all our obligations and liabilities to you in relation to the claim at our discretion either: credit your trading account with an amount equal to any monies you have paid to us for the unreceived Goods; refund any monies you have paid to us for the unreceived Goods; or dispatch to you or your end customer the unreceived Goods.<br>
              8.5.    If the Buyer notifies us that any of the Goods received were damaged whilst they were at the Seller's risk or do not conform to these terms and conditions or differ to the Goods ordered then the Buyer must promptly return the Goods and provide reasonable evidence supporting the claim. If the Seller accepts the claim then the Seller will by way of full and final settlement of all obligations and liabilities in relation to the claim at the Seller's discretion either: refund any monies paid for the damaged/non-conforming Goods; repair the damaged/non-conforming Goods; or replace them with Goods that conform with these terms and conditions.<br>
