You can watch our video for a full demo of all the steps in this tutorial. Open the video in a new tab to avoid leaving Bitbucket.\n\nEdit a file\nYou’ll start by editing this README file to learn how to edit a file in Bitbucket.\n\nClick Source on the left side.\nClick the README.md link from the list of files.\nClick the Edit button.\nDelete the following text: Delete this line to make a change to the README from Bitbucket.\nAfter making your change, click Commit and then Commit again in the dialog. The commit page will open and you’ll see the change you just made.\nGo back to the Source page.\n\n\nCreate a file\nNext, you’ll add a new file to this repository.\n\nClick the New file button at the top of the Source page.\nGive the file a filename of contributors.txt.\nEnter your name in the empty file space.\nClick Commit and then Commit again in the dialog.\nGo back to the Source page.\n\nBefore you move on, go ahead and explore the repository. You've already seen the Source page, but check out the Commits, Branches, and Settings pages.\n\nClone a repository\nUse these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, download and install first. If you prefer to clone from the command line, see Clone a repository.\n\nYou’ll see the clone button under the Source heading. Click that button.\nNow click Check out in SourceTree. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.\nWhen you see the Clone New dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click Clone.\nOpen the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.\n\nNow that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree, or you can add, commit, and push from the command line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n    Modules\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
